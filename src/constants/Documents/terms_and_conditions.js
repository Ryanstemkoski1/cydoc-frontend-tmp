            The Cydoc Service is a cloud-based platform that assists healthcare
            providers in accelerating the medical note writing process. The
            Cydoc Service allows an accountholder to generate a text note based
            on case-specific information (e.g., about a particular patient) that
            you provide or that you have asked a patient or their representative
            to provide through the Cydoc Service.  Further terms regarding user
            accounts are set forth on the attached Exhibit A, User Accounts.
