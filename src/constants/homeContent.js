Step 3: Behind the scenes, our software transforms the intake Q&A into a medical note, available to you before the visit starts. Step 4: You begin the visit with a note ready to go and key information already collected. Sign up today and start saving time!',

In addition to an HPI, our generated note includes updated medications, allergies, past medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, and review of systems.',
