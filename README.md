# cydoc-frontend

The frontend works with Node.js version 10.1.0.

# Installation
Follow the tutorials linked to below to install Semantic UI. When you clone this repo and run `npm install` it will take you through 
an interactive installer. Make sure you install in src/semantic when it asks you (both for semantic and dist). 

You will need to run `npm install` to install the dependencies for React and Semantic UI and then 
you can run `npm start` and the app will build and run.

[Tutorial: How to Use Semantic UI with a Custom Theme](https://jsramblings.com/2018/03/04/how-to-use-semantic-ui-with-a-custom-theme-in-your-CRA-app.html)

You will need to navigate to localhost:3000 to see the app (or whichever port you are using).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Useful Commands

To run the app in development mode, run the following command in the project directory:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Before Submitting a PR

Before committing changes, please run `npm run lint` to lint.

To fix the linting errors automatically, run `npm run lint fix`.

Then, run `npm run lint` again and manually fix any remaining errors.

Before submitting a PR, `npm run lint` should output the following:

- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for src/index.js
- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for src/contexts
- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for tests
- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for src/components
- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for src/constants
- ðŸ˜„  No linting errors found for src/pages
- ðŸ˜„ No linting errors found for src/auth

# Testing with Jest and Enzyme

To get started with testing, in your terminal run these two commands:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
npm install --save-dev enzyme jest-enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

In your test file (e.g. EditProfile.test.js), include these imports:

```
import React from 'react'
import Enzyme from 'enzyme'
import EnzymeAdapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'
import ComponentToBeTested from 'wherever/component/is/located'
```

Also in your test file, include this single line to set up the testing:

```
Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() })
```

When testing, it will also be common to have this import:

```
import Enzyme, { shallow } from 'enzyme'
```

And this corresponding line of code within a test:

```
const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />)
```

(the method shallow renders the single component you are testing, it does not render child components -- to render child components it is common to use mount instead of shallow)

Typically, tests will follow this format:

```
test('short description of the test', () => {
     expect(something)
});
```

If you want to group tests together within the file, use:

```
describe('here is a group of tests', () => {
     test('test one', () => { });
     test('test two', () => { });
});
```
